If you’ve been craving that warm, buttery aroma of fresh-baked cookies, you’re in the right place. This recipe is here to guide you through making the ultimate soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies, step by step.

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 2 eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 teaspoons hot water

- 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

**Instructions:**
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line your baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Cream together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and fluffy.
3. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.
4. Dissolve baking soda in the hot water and mix it into the batter along with the salt.
5. Gradually stir in the flour until just combined, then fold in the chocolate chips.
6. Drop large spoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them apart.
7. Bake for 8–10 minutes until the edges are lightly golden. Cool on the sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack.

Serve with a cold glass of milk or surprise your friends with a plateful. These cookies are best enjoyed warm, but they’re so good they rarely last long enough to cool!
